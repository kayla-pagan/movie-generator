# Movie Generator

This project has helped me get some more practice using the fetch() method
to request data. This time I incorporated https://www.omdbapi.com/ to GET
data on movies. I crated a search bar to find movies that can then be added
to a personal watchlist that is saved to localStorage.

I also had further opportunity to learn how to read through documentation that
is usually provided on how to obtain the data I needed to incorporate into this project.
